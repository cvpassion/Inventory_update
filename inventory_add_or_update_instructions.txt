Goal: scan a QR code -> open a webpage -> fill in the respective fields -> click save -> automatically updates inventory sheet live.

1. The QR code opens a link, which opens a form, accepts the input, and writes it into a sheet. We need to build a web app for this purpose. Web app (FastAPI) would write the values to the google sheet.

2. Therefore, a web server app (FastAPI) was created. All the details for this are mentioned in the python file main.py. Inside main.py, the line app = FastAPI() creates the web app.

Example:

@app.get("/") → homepage

@app.get("/new") → new entry form

@app.get("/edit") → pick an existing AssetID

@app.post(...) → save data to the sheet

3. The webpage that people would click was made using HTML templates inside a folder called templates/:
start.html, which shows New or Edit
edit_pick.html, that lets you pick an AssetID (searchable using keywords)
form.html, which is the actual form with all the columns
FastAPI serves these pages.

4. The web app was then connected to the Google Sheets. To let python edit a Google Sheet, we need Google permission.
(i)  Step 1: Create a google cloud project : https://console.cloud.google.com/
                 Create a new project, and enable google sheets and google drive API.

     Step 2: Enable APIs
                 Inside your project:
                 Go to: APIs & Services → Library
                 Enable: Sheets API = read/write spreadsheet, 
                 Drive API = permission access to open by ID

     Step 3: Create Service Account
                Go to: APIs & Services → Credentials
                Click: Create Credentials → Service Account
                Give it a name
                Create
                No special permissions needed here.

     Step 4: Create JSON Key
                 Inside the Service Account: Go to “Keys” tab
                 Click “Add Key”
                 Choose JSON
                 Download
                 This file is your robot identity.

It contains: client_email, private_key, project_id. This is what your server uses to authenticate.

     Step 5: Share Your Google Sheet
                Open your Google Sheet.
                Click Share.
                Paste the email found inside your JSON file.

 A .env file is created which stores the values of the variables "SPREADSHEET_ID" and "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS", instead of typing it every time. This is then loaded into   Python.

   Step 6: Create a local folder (say, qr-sheet-app) on your computer.
Copy main.py, templates/ (html files), .env, requirements.txt and all required files into this folder. Copy the folder path. Let us say, it is C:\Users\14129\Documents\qr-sheet-app


1. Open powershell, and go to your project. Type cd "C:\Users\14129\Documents\qr-sheet-app"
2. Install dependents. Type pip install -r requirements.txt pip install python-dotenv
3. Run server: uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001 --reload --access-log. Note that this server is only for the local host, which has further been updated to the public server generated through Render.

The server is just a python program. When the link is opened, it receives the request, runs the python function, and sends back the html page. 

The link is accessible to be updated only by people with a cmu Andrew id. To do this, the allowed domain was restricted to andrew.cmu.edu. A public url was deployed using Render.
